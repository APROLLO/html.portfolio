<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>Im a technology professional with a strong background in IT operations, infrastructure, and application support, currently expanding deeper into software development and automation. I’ve worked across enterprise and hybrid environments, supporting critical systems while delivering reliable, scalable solutions.
My interests sit at the intersection of infrastructure, backend development, and DevOps, where I enjoy turning complex problems into practical, well-engineered systems. Im actively building projects that showcase real-world skills in system design, automation, and software delivery.
This website is a space to document my journey, share projects, and demonstrate how I approach technology with a focus on reliability, efficiency, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>I recently just started relearning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other front end languages with the intention of eventually pivoting my career in to full stack web development</p>

<h2>Dreams and Aspirations:</h2>
<p>My long-term goal is to grow into a well-rounded software developer while leveraging the infrastructure and operations experience I’ve built throughout my career. Having worked close to production systems, enterprise platforms, and real-world operational challenges, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for how software behaves outside of textbooks and development environments.I aspire to work at the intersection of development, infrastructure, and automation, where code is not only written to function, but to scale, perform, and remain reliable under real-world conditions. My background in systems engineering and application support gives me a practical mindset — I understand uptime, monitoring, deployments, failures, and the impact technology has on users and businesses.Rather than starting from zero, my aim is to transition into development by building on what I already know: designing backend services with operational awareness, automating workflows, and creating software that is production-ready from day one. Over time, I want to deepen my expertise in backend development, cloud-native architectures, and DevOps practices, ultimately contributing to systems that are both elegant in design and resilient in operation.
  This journey is intentional, hands-on, and grounded in continuous learning — turning experience into capability, and ambition into real, measurable progress..</p>
